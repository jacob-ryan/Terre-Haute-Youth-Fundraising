Fundraising management solution for Big Brothers Big Sisters (BBBS) of Vigo County, IN.
This project is being developed by Jacob Ryan, Zach Haloski, Greg Brandes, and David Patterson.  The resulting software product will comprise our Senior Project for Rose-Hulman's CSSE department.  Project management is tracked using a Trello board, which allows us to organize requirements and feature progress for each sprint (a 2-week "release cycle").
